### Solid State Drives

#### 4TB

- **Inland** Platinum 4TB SSD M.2 2280 NVMe PCIe Gen 3.0 x 4 3D NAND Internal Solid State Drive, PCIe Express 3.1 and NVMe 1.3 Compatible - *Credit [brademerica](https://www.reddit.com/r/pop_os/comments/wbk9pm/comment/ii7ck08/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)*  
Where to buy: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Inland-Platinum-Internal-Compatible-Solutions/dp/B08FT8LFNM)

### Monitors
- SAMSUNG 49-inch Odyssey G9 Gaming Monitor:  
Monitors max resolution is 5120x1440p and max refresh rate is 120Hz. All resolutions are supported. In the settings it shows as 'Unknown 49"' with a refresh rate selection of 59.98Hz only, it should go up to 120Hz, it shows that on my Pop_OS! Linux desktop. This could be due to the HDMI cable limitations. I will check with other cables and also try the USB-C port using an adapter since the Monitor doesn't have a USB-C monitor input.

### Hubs
- [DELL D6000 Universal USB-C/USB-A Dock](https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/product-support/product/dell-universal-dock-d6000/docs), [Spec Sheet (PDF)](https://www.delltechnologies.com/asset/en-us/products/electronics-and-accessories/technical-support/Dell_Universal_Dock_D6000_Spec_Sheet.pdf)  
On the back it has 1x Power Input, 1x HDMI, 2x DisplayLink, 1x Ethernet, 2x USB 3.0, 1x Speaker Out and in the front it has 1x USB 3.0, 1x USB 3.0/BC1.2, 1x USB-C/BC1.2, 1x Audio Combo. The cable to the computer is a USB-C along with an adapter for USB-A!  
**Important**: If you DO NOT already have the display link drivers installed for Pop_OS!, you need to install them in order to use the displayLink ports in the back. [Download the displayLink drivers](https://www.synaptics.com/products/displaylink-graphics/downloads/ubuntu).  
*Note: A nice to have is if you use the USB-C port to connect to the HP Dev One, the dock will charge the HP Dev One.  
There is also a version D6000S, which DOES NOT have any audio jacks! Info by [raldara on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dell/comments/vn617z/comment/ie5bh28/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)*  
Where to buy: newegg [New](https://www.newegg.com/black-dell-d6000/p/1DN-0002-000H2)/[Refurbished](https://www.newegg.com/dell-d6000-black/p/1DN-0002-00581), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Dell-452-BCYT-D6000-Universal-Black/dp/B071YTQBXM)

### Chargers

- 65W Type C USB AC Charger  
This charge is affordable and charges the HP Dev One through it's USB-C port.  
Where to buy: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09B78WPXK)  

*Note: Additional chargers are great when you travel between different locations, like home and office. Have a charger for each location. Always the worse when you get where you need to go and the charge was forgotten :D*

## Function Keys Explained
HP didn't include any explanation about the FN Keys. So this is where this section comes in handy, it will add a quick description to the FN Keys.
FN-F1: Screen symbol with a bar to the right and the left

## Videos

### Removing and Replacing Parts

- [Removing & Replacing Parts by HP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkAOS9f5p1I) - Great find by [cutememe](https://www.reddit.com/r/System76/comments/wlpfrk/comment/ikf5oys/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)  
*Note: Even though this is for the HP EliteBook 845 G8 Notebook it can be fully applied to the HP Dev One, aside of a few exceptions/differences mentioned below.*  
List of exceptions/differences in this video that do NOT apply to the HP Dev One:
  - The screws to open the case are not P1 Phillips-Head screws, they are Torx T5 screws for the HP Dev One.
  - The video shows a WAN module covered by a mylar shield, the HP Dev One does NOT have this piece of hardware
  - The video shows an NFC Board, the HP Dev One does NOT have this piece of hardware
  - The video shows a Smart Card Board, the HP Dev One does NOT have this piece of hardware 
  - The video shows a Fingerprint Reader Board, the HP Dev One does NOT have this piece of hardware

## Pros and Cons

**ðŸŸ¥ IN PROGRESS ðŸŸ¥**

| Pros | Cons |
| :------------ | :--------- |
| Offers USB-C & USB-A Ports | Glossy Display contributes to eye strain |
| Can be charged through the USB-C Port | |

## Using Other Linux Distributions

It is possible to use any linux distribution in place of Pop OS. The only downside being that you can't update the firmware or bios without some additional work. 

The official documentation for [System 76 firmware upgrade](https://support.system76.com/articles/system-firmware/) suggests to use a live-usb of Pop OS to create an environment for updating the firmware.

### Arch Linux
- For Arch Linux, you can install the `firmware-manager` and `system76-firmware` from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/).
	- Once installed, execute `fwupdmgr refresh --force` to identify your device and relevant updates with the service.
	- From here, you can use the GTK-based GUI in Firmware Manager to update. If you have an issue with checksum authentication, run the commend `fwupdmgr get-updates` followed by `fwupdmgr install --force` to force the upgrade.

## Support and Connect Information

### Known Issues

- On boot, the bios may show the `90B` System Fan Error. This is a known bug that was patched with a later firmware/bios update. If you experience this issue, update the firmware.
